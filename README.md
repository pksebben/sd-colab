# sd-colab
A database and api for coordinating time shares on collaborative art space machinery. Conceived in the context of the San Diego Colab coworking space, and then completed for the hell of it because they decided to stick with wordpress extensions (there are no hard feelings).

interface allows for CRUD operations on members and workstations, and allows reserving time on a particular workstation with collision detection.

# TODO

Planned features include authentication (and associated security checking), administrative control, and alternative formats for I/O.

# Disclaimer

This is incomplete software, and as such is full of security holes and a host of bugs that trust me, you want no part in.  This is part of the reason it is not packaged for a server; my assumption is that if you can figure out how to use it, you can figure out why not to.  I take no responsibility for the outcome of any use, misuse, or abuse of this program whether loose, obtuse, or chartreuse.
